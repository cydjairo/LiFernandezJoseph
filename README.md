### KDramaChingu (tentative)
##### Have you ever had the feeling of wanting to take a break and watch a K-drama, so you search for one to watch, but then you realize that hours have passed just by scrolling through lists, and you haven't even watched a single episode. Now, fear not, because KDramaChingu is here.

##### KDramaChingu is a website to help hesitant people, like us, pick a K-drama that would be worth their watch. The dramas would be sorted into genres, then a synopsis and the platforms you can watch it on would be provided with it. There would be 4 Main Genres, namely Romance, Action, Historical, Horror, and Medical/Legal Kdramas.

### Outline:

##### Page One: Home Page
###### This will have the 4 Main Genres displayed. Additionally, the user would be able to interact and click the genres displayed, which would lead to the webpage/category of their choice.

##### Page Two: Romance
###### This will have the romance dramas sorted into sub-genres like fictional, drama etc.

##### Page Three: Action
###### This will have the action dramas sorted into sub-genres like  fictional,  etc.

##### Page Four: Historical
###### This will have the historical dramas sorted into sub-genres like romance, comedy, action etc.

##### Page Five: Horror

##### Page Six: Medical/Legal
###### This will have the medical/legal dramas sorted into sub-genres like romance, comedy, drama etc.
